### Overview
This project leverages IoT and machine learning to predict agricultural crop yields using real-time environmental data. By integrating an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor, the system collects temperature and humidity data, processes it using a trained TensorFlow Lite model, and provides yield predictions. The results are visualized on ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring.

2. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer.
3. Select the appropriate board (ESP32) and COM port in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

#### **4. Run the Prediction Script**
1. Open the terminal in the project directory.
2. Start the Python script for predictions:
   ```bash
    python yield_df.py
    python app.py
    python tflite.py

   ```

### Usage
1. Power on the ESP32 and ensure the DHT11 sensor is connected.
2. Start the Python prediction script (`tflite.py`) on your computer.
3. The ESP32 collects sensor data and sends it to the Python server for processing.
4. The TensorFlow Lite model processes the data and returns the predicted yield.
5. Predictions are displayed on ThingSpeak for easy visualization.

### System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The ESP32 microcontroller collects temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor.
2. **Data Transmission**:
   - Sensor data is sent to the Python server via HTTP requests.
3. **Prediction**:
   - The TensorFlow Lite model (`model.tflite`) processes the incoming data.
   - Preprocessing is handled using the `preprocessor.joblib` pipeline.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Predictions are uploaded to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.

### Example Usage
#### Input:
- **Temperature**: DT11 value
- **Rainfall**: DT11 value

#### Output:
- **Predicted Yield**: 85,432(example) kg/ha.
